# Shinylive CN-US Productivity App

This repository hosts a lightweight, browser-based Shinylive app for visualizing and comparing productivity indicators across **Canada** and the **United States** from 1961 to 2023. The app is built in R using the `shiny`, `ggplot2`, and `shinylive` packages, and it runs entirely in the browser without a server.
